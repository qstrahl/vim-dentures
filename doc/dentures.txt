INTRODUCTION                                    *dentures*

Dentures introduces the following |text-objects| to vim, all of which are
available in |visual-mode| and |operator-pending-mode|:

TEXT OBJECTS                                    *dentures-text-objects*

                                                *dentures-ai* *v_ai* *ai*
ai                      "an indenture", select a block of indented text plus
                        surrounding whitespace.

                                                *dentures-ii* *v_ii* *ii*
ii                      "indenture", select a block of indented text.

                                                *dentures-aI* *v_aI* *aI*
aI                      "an INDENTURE", select adjacent blocks of indented
                        text plus surrounding whitesace.

                                                *dentures-iI* *v_iI* *iI*
iI                      "INDENTURE", select adjacent blocks of indented text.

CUSTOMIZING                                     *dentures-customizing*

The above mappings are default settings. They won't replace existing mappings,
and they won't be created if you map dentures to other keys. The defaults are:

vmap ii <Plug>(InnerDenture)
vmap iI <Plug>(InnerDENTURE)
vmap ai <Plug>(OuterDenture)
vmap aI <Plug>(OuterDENTURE)

omap ii <Plug>(InnerDenture)
omap iI <Plug>(InnerDENTURE)
omap ai <Plug>(OuterDenture)
omap aI <Plug>(OuterDENTURE)

TAKE A BITE                                     *dentures-examples*
                                                *dentures-and-you*

The best way to wrap your head around dentures is to take a bite; try out each
of the |text-objects| introduced by this plugin for yourself. Great care has
been taken to ensure they behave in a way that is sensible and familiar.

To illustrate where dentures really shine, try chewing in |visual-block| mode:

    <C-v>ii         select indenture
    I(<Esc>         prepend "("
    gv              reselect previous
    A)<Esc>         append ")"

Combine with other operators for extra chewing power! Try it with |surround|:

    <C-v>ii         (select indenture)
    S(              (surround with parens)
